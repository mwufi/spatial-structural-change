I've half a mind to create a simulator.js project

to build this model, and to really understand it
is to go from the ground up


at a given time, the relevant variables are:
goods
	prices
investment
	prices
regions
	people
	agriculture
	productivity
interest rate
people
	savings
	locations
	things they want to buy
	skills

how do we decide if people move?
how do we set the prices of goods?
how do we determine how productive each region is?
