# Weekly Update for 5/8, Tuesday - Monday

Terrific start to this project - I went from not really grasping the model clearly to 
having a firm idea of all the pieces involved. Saturday's chat with Fabian helped with seeing the big picture (sometimes you need someone to remind you of that!), of the wages and locations updating themselves.

On the technical side, I spent a lot of time testing and writing functions, getting the matrices right. So it pays off.. within one week, we (almost) have a working forward model.
