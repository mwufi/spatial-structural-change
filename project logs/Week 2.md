# Week of 5/15, Tuesday - Monday

Tuesday - 8 hours
	Checking the results by computing the interest rate (should get the same as the input), but this didn't work out. So then I tried to see why it wasn't converging to the right values

Wednesday - 8.5 hours
	Still tried to check on the converged values (the spatial allocation, in particular)
	[Skype call]
	From the call, we changed three things: Q turned out to be already raised to some power, there was something in solving for wages, and we needed to normalize things differently.
	Focused on readability: rewrote most of the small functions, and did sanity-checks on them. So now we know that they're doing the right thing...

Thursday - 7 hours
	Added price normalization
	Focused on rewriting the loop to solve for wages. So that works..
	L takes longer to converge now...
    
Friday - 3 hours
    So far..
    Bugs in the wage loop. Somehow it explodes now.

Total: 24 hours
